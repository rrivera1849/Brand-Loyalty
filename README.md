# Overview
Brand loyalty is a chief concern for marketers of grocery products. Consumers will often buy the same brand of a household good for their entire lives. 
It is vital for marketers to determine which consumers are especially ‘brand loyal’ so that the stores can target advertising and promotions toward them.
We seek to classify households as ‘brand loyal’ or not, and then use machine learning techniques to model demographic characteristics that contribute 
to their loyalty or lack thereof.
